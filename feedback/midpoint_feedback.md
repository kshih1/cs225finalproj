### Comments

The group has implemented BFS so far and has a done a very thorough job testing it as well. They have made decent progress in data parsing and working through some issues with the weights and calculating the spherical distances between airports. They have a plan for implementing the final two algorithms that is Dijkstra's and Betweeness Centrality. They need to put a little more planning into how they will implement Betweeness Centrality though. Overall they're in a good position to finish strong.
