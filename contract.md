 Team Contract 

  

## Communication 

1. **Team Meetings** Our team will meet twice a week on 

   Tuesday: 6:30 to 8:30 pm  
   Saturday: 2:00 to 4:00 pm  

   Ideally in person if possible or using zoom. Each member should be upfront about other time commitments and try their best to settle on a regular time. Each member will          rotate being the designated note-taker, starting with rithvik9. Notes will be stored on a Google document with good naming conventions and timestamps. The note-taker is also 
   responsible for drafting the weekly DEVELOPMENT LOG entry, which is approved by the team at the start of the following week’s meeting. 

 

2. **Assistance** Each team member can be contacted through email, Instagram DMs and discord, which is where most of the sharing of files and resources will happen. Outside of 
emergencies and other unique circumstances, each team member should respond on Instagram within a maximum of 24 hours, but ideally within a couple hours when possible. 

  

3. **Respect** The note-taker for the week will also serve as the ‘project lead’ for the weekly meeting. Their role is to ensure that every member of the group has had a chance 
to speak or state their opinion about a design decision or any other topic related to the final project. All decisions will be accepted by simple majority – while unanimous 
agreement is preferred, it is not required. By signing this document, each member of the team commits to adhering to the decisions made, even if they personally disagree with 
them.   

  

## Collaboration 

  

1. **Work Distribution** Each week, the necessary deliverables for the week will be determined by the full team and each member will volunteer to work on one or more 
deliverables. When no one volunteers, two team members will be randomly assigned to work on the task as a paired-programming team by the project lead. If this leads to an 
unbalanced workload for the week, adjustments can be made on a case-by-case basis. 

  

2. **Time Commitment** To ensure an equal distribution of work, each member is expected to independently work no less than two and no more than six hours per week on the 
project. If a deliverable ends up taking more time, the rest of the team should be pulled in to assist with the unforeseen complication, with each member taking an equal share 
of the workload or programming in pairs. It is the team’s responsibility, not the individual’s responsibility, to make sure a weekly deliverable is finished by the end of the 
week. However, if a team member is habitually not completing their individual tasks, they may be asked – politely – to explain their circumstances. Based on their explanation 
further actions, such as alerting a staff member, may be taken on a case by case basis as decided by the other team members. 

  

3. **Conflict Resolution** All conflicts within the team will be decided by a thorough group discussion in which every member explains their viewpoint honestly while being 
respectful of others. Afterwards, the team will attempt to vote or compromise to reach a common consensus regarding the matter. If no resolution is found through the discussion,
then further action could be taken such as reaching out to the mentor or staff member.
