Week #1
What goals you had set for the week and whether they were accomplished or not:
Our goals for this week were to first meet and get to know each other and become familiar with one another. Then, we wanted to better understand how to pull the data and parse through it as none of us had any ideas initially
What specific tasks each member of your team accomplished in the week:
We were all assigned to research how to pull and parse the data files from the Airport database through various sources like the internet and any prior experience we may have. We will discuss these findings in our in person meeting over the weekend.
What problems you encountered (if any) that prevented you from meeting your goals:
No problems currently.
What you plan to accomplish next week:
After understanding how to pull and parse the data, we wish to begin the framework for making the datasets readable and usable.

Week #2
What goals you had set for the week and whether they were accomplished or not:
Our goals this week were to draw up a basic framework of how we wanted to tackle the project and start assigning specific sections to different people to work on. Our goals were accomplished.
What specific tasks each member of your team accomplished in the week:
Each member completed their assigned share of work: Rithvik completed data parsing code skeleton and methods, Kelly completed drawing up the class framework, and Anushka and Sanjivani completed Dijkstra's algo research and implementation framework.
What problems you encountered (if any) that prevented you from meeting your goals:
No problems currently.
What you plan to accomplish next week:
Now that we can successfully pull and parse data, we wish to be able to finish up our search algorithm next week.

Week #3
What goals you had set for the week and whether they were accomplished or not:
Our goal this week was to finish the BFS implementation with the parsed datasets
What specific tasks each member of your team accomplished in the week:
Each member completed their assigned share of work: Rithvik completed implementation of data processing within the classes, Kelly completed drawing up the test cases, Anushka completed the BFS algorithm framework, and Sanjivani worked on Dijkstra's algo research and implementation framework.
What problems you encountered (if any) that prevented you from meeting your goals:
No problems currently.
What you plan to accomplish next week:
We wish to commence implementing Dijkstra's.

Week #4
What goals you had set for the week and whether they were accomplished or not:
After having our mentor meeting, we are on track. For the meeting we managed to demonstrate our completed BFS algorithm as well as test cases using catch demonstrating that the
BFS works as expected for our directed graph. We ran into some issues with the data parsing functions so the goal this week was primarily to fix these issues as well as to finish research and begin implementation on our next 2 algorithms.
What specific tasks each member of your team accomplished in the week: 
Each member completed their assigned share of work: Rithvik went back and fixed the data parsing functions, Kelly added more cohesive test cases for BFS, Anushka did some preliminary research into betweenness centrality, and Sanjivani continued her work on implementing Dijkstra's. 
What problems you encountered (if any) that prevented you from meeting your goals:
When running catch test cases, we realized that we were seg faulting in the data parsing aspect. We were not able to fix this in time for the mentor meeting but since BFS worked
fine with test cases is was okay and we are fixing the data parsing.
What you plan to accomplish next week:
We plan on working on Dijkstra's and researching/begin implementation on betweenness centrality. 

Week #5
What goals you had set for the week and whether they were accomplished or not:
Our goals this week were to make sure that the data parsing works and that the Dijkstra's algorithm was on track for completion, as well as drawing out a framework for betweenness centrality. Our goals were accomplished
What specific tasks each member of your team accomplished in the week: 
Each member completed their assigned share of work: Rithvik revised the data parsing functions and did some extra testing as well as implementing comments and the README, Kelly drew up tests for Dijkstra's and went through and commented her code along with drawing up a README, Anushka also went and commented her code along with a README, and Sanjivani continued her work on implementing Dijkstra's. 
What problems you encountered (if any) that prevented you from meeting your goals:
No problems yet, but our current Dijkstra's approach is something we are optimizing with a meeting over the weekend.
What you plan to accomplish next week:
We plan on finishing Dijkstra's and finishing betweenness centrality along with having all the comments and readme's done.
